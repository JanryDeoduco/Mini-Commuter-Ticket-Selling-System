## Code Description

Describe what your code does here

My code makes a simple transport terminal cater by accepting commuters that are classified into two: regulars and seniors/PWDs. The vehicles are also classified into two: bus/taxi. My code has a feature wherein it detects if the capacity is already full wherein it will not accept any commuters. It also has a discount for seniors/pwds. Furthermore, it prints the list of passenger for each vehicle with ID and other information

## Things you did in the code

Describe what you did here
These are the following things I did in my code:
- Encapsulation (Making confidential informations private)
- inheritance (Extending abstract classes)
- polymorphism (Treating Bus and Taxi as a vehicle)
- abstraction (inheriting the methods and attributes from abstract class)
## Challenges encountered

Describe your challenges here
- One of my main challenges is applying polymorphism since I am used to java wherein I am using same method name but different paramters which didn't work in dart. Moreover, I am very confused in understanding the main problem, therefore, it took me a long time to start coding.
